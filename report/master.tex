\end{description}

\section{Preliminary Way of Work}
All members will meet each workday in the lab at 9 AM if able to work on the project.

Every Monday after lunch a meeting will be held to wrap up the previous week and make any necessary preparations for the Tuesday presentation.

After each day it is recommended to write down what sub-projects one has worked on and what is planned for the next day/week;
this will greatly streamline the Monday meetings and ensure that every team member always have something to work on.

If we later find a better way to manage our work,
or if we find that we deviate from what is planned above,
an updated Way of Work will be appended to the appendix of this document.

\subsection{How the system is composed}
The current plan is to build the robot mostly with the lego ev3 parts. The mobile platform will be built with the parts present in the package given to the group in the beginning of the project. The arm, which will grip the cube, will be built from external lego parts and motors, the list of these parts will be submitted during this Tuesday. A resberry pie will be used for the communication between sensors and motors, all calculations for the control systems will also be computed in it. A preliminary model has been calculated for the forward kinematics of the system, this will probably be updated and an inverse kinematic model will be derived. The decision has not yet been made on how the location of the robot will be calculated, some of the possible navigation systems that have been discussed are; LIDAR, Sonar, using decawave sensors present at the universit using wifi triangulation, using inductive or capacitive sensors for fine tuning of the arm. 

\subsection{structure of work}
\subsubsection{Milestones}
Communication with motor shield; \newline
Position/navigation system; \newline
Simple model simulation and implementation of model; \newline
Contruction and modeling of robot arm.
\subsubsection{Tecchnical solutions in the project}
Assignements will be created in Git where smaller tasks for the project will be assigned to members, these tasks will in turn be parts of the milestones. Lukas will be supervising the group memebers from control engineering to see the technical solutions chosen and the progress beeing done, while Viktor will be supervising the group members studying computer science.
